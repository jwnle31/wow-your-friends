## What is this exactly?
**Celeste** is a game about climbing a mountain, but more accurately, climbing your mountain. It's personally one of my favorite games of all time because of how well-crafted it is, from its story to its game design to its challenge towards all skill levels.

One of those challenges, which could be considered the hardest of them all, is collecting all 202 strawberries. The majority of them are search-and-collect, but then there are the *golden strawberries*. These are much harder to collect, as they can only be collected by completing a chapter without dying, from start to finish. Not many have persevered that far to collect them all.

And recently, Celeste had gotten its long-awaited DLC: *Chapter 9: Farewell*. And this introduced one more golden strawberry into the mix, which is, by far, the hardest berry to be collected. Only about a dozen, verified players had been able to obtain that berry after a couple of months; & quite a few more are hoping to join that group of players.

This is where this comes in. *Wow Your Friends* is a record of every player who managed to get every strawberry in Celeste. It's a really enduring task for players to go for this, & this is why I want to commemorate the efforts of those players in a more meaningful way. It's not easy, trust me.
